    <h1>To Do Page</h1>
    <p>
      The obligatory implementation of a simple To-Do app.  
      Since I don't want the hassle of an actual backend datastore 
      (like SQL Server or Mongo DB) I'm using Dexie to store.
    </p>
    <p>We'll have two separate sorts of tasks: Once-and-done tasks and tasks that repeat and can be assigned days of the week.</p>
